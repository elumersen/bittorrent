Introduction to BitTorrent:

In the landscape of digital file-sharing and peer-to-peer (P2P) networks,
BitTorrent stands out as a groundbreaking protocol that revolutionized the 
way large files are distributed across the internet.Developed by programmer 
Bram Cohen in 2001, BitTorrent introduced a decentralized approach to file 
sharing, allowing users to distribute and download files efficiently without relying on a central server.
