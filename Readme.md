The is BitTorrent File Sharing Project enables decentralized file sharing among computers using the BitTorrent protocol.Participants act as seeders, hosting files, and leechers, who download them.

This README provides guidelines for setting up file sharing via BitTorrent. Please follow the instructions carefully for seamless sharing between computers.

Instructions for File Sharing using BitTorrent:

Seeder Side:

Navigate to the seeder folder.
Run the command go run seeder.go to start the server (seeder).
Leecher Side:

Navigate to the leecher folder.
Run the command go run leecher.go to start the client (file requester).

Before executing these procedures, ensure that both computers are connected to the same network, and their IP addresses are known. Then, replace the placeholder IP addresses with the actual IP addresses of the computers, and you're ready to proceed.
